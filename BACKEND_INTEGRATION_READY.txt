Hey! Backend integration is ready for testing. Here's what's wired up:

Auth Flow (Complete & Connected to Backend):
1. Login Screen → Calls /api/auth/login with email & password
2. Signup Screen → Calls /api/auth/register with username, email & password  
3. Verification Screen → Calls /api/auth/verify-email with email & 6-digit OTP code
4. Business Details Screen → Calls /api/business/register with business info

What Each Endpoint Should Return:

Login/Signup: 
{
  "token": "auth_token_here",
  "user": {
    "id": "user_id",
    "email": "user@email.com",
    "username": "username",
    "business_name": "optional"
  }
}

Email Verification:
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Email verified"
}

Business Register:
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Business registered"
}

All endpoints have:
- Auto token management in headers (Bearer token)
- 30-second timeout
- Proper error handling & user feedback
- Loading states on all buttons

Ready to test end-to-end flow: Login → Signup → Verification → Business Details → Dashboard

Any issues, check the app logs or let me know!
